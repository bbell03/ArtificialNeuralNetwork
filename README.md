### CODE DETAILS

  #### IMPLEMENTATION:

  We expect that our solution has been completely and correctly implemented. The code was written in Python 3.

  #### ARCHITECTURE:

  Our solution makes use of an Artificial Neural Network in order to classify plants according to values corresponding to the length and width of both their petals and sepals.

  According to standard procedure, our Neural Network trains on the dataset ANN -- Iris data.txt using forward propogation followed by backward propogation to generalize attributes for each type of plant so as to predict type on attribute input.

  We use various helper functions in addition to a Neural Network class complete with its own member functions to implement the solution.

  Our Neural Network randomly selects 100/150 data entries in order to train itself, and then tests the validity of the training process on the remaining 50 individuals. It prints the accuracy score of the prediction on both trainset and testset. And the average accuracy score reachs a 0.96.

  Helper functions include boolean return functions for each of the three types of plant, and a sigmoid function that serves as the activation function for this artificial neural net.

  We also make use of python libraries numpy and pandas for mathematical operations.

  #### USAGE:

  Run the .py file in any Python IDE.
